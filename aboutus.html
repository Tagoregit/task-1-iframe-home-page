        A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. 
        Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, 
        seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over cargo.
        There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. 
        The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.[citation needed]

        The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, 
        while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal 
        combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical,
        marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, 
        when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
        Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. 
        The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, 
        both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-produced
        and mass-affordablecars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, 
        where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.
        In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.
        In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India,
        and other newly industrialised countries
